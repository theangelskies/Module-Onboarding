        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a vital document that introduces and explains a
          project. It provides essential information such as the project’s
          purpose, features, installation steps, and usage instructions. For
          open-source or collaborative projects, it may also include
          contribution guidelines, credits, and license details. The README
          helps users and developers quickly understand how to use and interact
          with the project, making it an essential communication tool that
          promotes clarity, usability, and collaboration

        <h2>What is the Purpose of a Wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework
          of a website or app. It helps designers and developers plan layout,
          structure, and user flow before adding colors, images, or detailed
          content.

        <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git allows developers to work on different features or
          fixes independently from the main codebase. It promotes collaboration
          and experimentation without affecting the main project until changes
          are reviewed and merged.
